Facade Pattern
- Both the server class and client class represent subsystems that make up the
functionality of the program.

Iterator Pattern
- In order to send a message or update from the server to the clients, it
iterates through a list of clients to find the intended target, or to send the
same message to all clients in the case of a user logging in or out.

Observer Pattern
- The server creates a thread for each client created to listen for messages
used to update other clients.  Each client has a thread to listen for messages
from the server.
